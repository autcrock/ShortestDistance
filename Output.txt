SHOW sd.exe USAGE
Usage: sd switch [file|Map|StartEnd|nothing]

 Purpose: Manipulate and store a simple road network. Determine distances between locations with basic Dijkstra algorithm.
          sd can handle multiple disjoint place/road maps.  It will tell you if two places are not connected.
          NOTE: sd relies on its caller to ensure that road lengths are not negative.

 Argument types:

   - A map defines zero or more locations each with zero or more destinations: eg:
       '{"map":[{"place":"A", "destinations": [ {"to": "B", "distance": 100}, {"to": "C", "distance": 30}]}]}'
     Maps are used as inputs for map initialisation, place and road addition, deletion and updating where applicable.
     Single destination maps only must be used for road addition, deletion or updating where applicable.
     Multiple place and destination lists may be used for persistent map initialisation, or for addition of new places.
     Empty destination and place lists may be used for addition and deletion of roads and places respectively.

   - A StartEnd pair is JSON defining a pair of places for calculation of distance: eg
       '{"start": "A", "end": "B"}'

 Command line switches:

   sd [-ap, --addplace] Place - Add this place as JSON to the system file.
   sd [-c, --clear] - Remove the system file.
   sd [-xd, --xplace] Place - Delete this place as JSON from the system file.
   sd [-h, --help] - This message.  A persisistent road network is stored in a file for distance between locations.
   sd [-i, --initialise] filename - Initialise from a map definition in filename as JSON.  Remove system file first.
   sd [-ar, --addroad] Place - Add or modify a road from this place as JSON to the system file.
   sd [-s, --shortest] StartEnd - Find shortest path from place A to place B which are stored in a road network file.
                                  Returns either a JSON Distance or a message eg that the two places were not connected.
   sd [-v, --version] - Remove the system file.
   sd [-xr, --xroad] Place - Delete the road specified as JSON for this place from the system file.
